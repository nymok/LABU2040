                            <br>                 
                            During the practice session for the presentation, our group attempted to present our ideas in front of the class. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to prepare scripts, so we tried presenting without them. I made an effort to showcase our ideas without relying heavily on the slides. However, upon reviewing the recording of the rehearsal, I noticed that I used excessive body gestures due to nervousness. I should avoid unnecessary body movements during the presentation and strive to sound confident by embracing the recommendations I am suggesting. As a result, I have written a proper script and rehearsed it more than 10 times at home, practicing in front of the mirror. The goal is to reduce the number of excessive gestures.

                            Moreover, upon reviewing my speech during the practice session, I noticed that it lacked the necessary rapport to captivate the interest of the audience. While I did demonstrate respect towards the target audience, I failed to effectively convey the benefits they would gain from listening to and implementing the recommendations presented. In light of this, I made an effort to enhance my presentation by incorporating lines that would specifically engage the audience, who in this case were US expatriate managers. By establishing a connection between the recommendations and their personal interests, I aimed to pique their curiosity and encourage their continued attention throughout the presentation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, thanks to the instructor's feedback, I realized that our presentation could be more focused on the audience, making it more engaging and motivating for the target audience. Therefore, when writing the script, I made an effort to include motivating and engaging sentences, aiming to demonstrate our awareness of the audience.

                            After rehearsing with my teammates, we did our best in presenting our ideas. However, despite our efforts to reduce excessive body movements, I found that my body continued to move during the presentation, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. Therefore, I should have made a greater effort to minimize my body gestures.                        </span>

                            Furthermore, upon reviewing the recording of the presentation, I noticed that I frequently looked at the slides. Instead, I should have had more trust in my teammates and the materials we had prepared. Moving forward, I will focus on improving communication with my teammates and having faith in our teamwork during future presentations.

                            I have reviewed Lin Zhenyi's performance, and I greatly appreciate his excellent eye contact. He rarely looks at the slides and actively engages with various individuals in the audience. His eye contact creates a sense that he is speaking directly to the audience rather than to himself. Zhenyi has also utilized hand movements to emphasizes key points and enhances overall delivery. His performance reminded me of the importance of confidence. As if the speaker could first persuade himself of the contents, one would be able better persuade the audience about the content.                         </span>

                            When it comes to Zhenyi's use of voice, he displayed confidence by speaking smoothly and clearly, placing appropriate stress on key points. However, it would be beneficial for him to speak louder and establish a stronger rapport with the audience. To address this, I believe that recording the rehearsals and reviewing the recordings becomes crucial. By doing so, we can assess our pronunciation and volume, enabling us to make necessary adjustments for improvement. Additionally, I observed that Zhenyi effectively incorporated well-timed pauses in his speech, allowing the audience to absorb the information. This is a valuable technique that I can learn from and implement in my own presentations.                    </div>
