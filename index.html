                            <b>📌Body Gesture📌Confidence📌Audience Awareness</b>
                            <br>
                            During the practice session for the presentation, our group attempted to present our ideas in front of the class. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to prepare scripts, so we tried presenting without them. I made an effort to showcase our ideas without relying heavily on the slides. However, upon reviewing the recording of the rehearsal, I noticed that I used excessive body gestures due to nervousness. I should avoid unnecessary body movements during the presentation and strive to sound confident by embracing the recommendations I am suggesting. As a result, I have written a proper script and rehearsed it more than 10 times at home, practicing in front of the mirror. The goal is to reduce the number of excessive gestures.
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, thanks to the instructor's feedback, I realized that our presentation could be more focused on the audience, making it more engaging and motivating for the target audience. Therefore, when writing the script, I made an effort to include motivating and engaging sentences, aiming to demonstrate our awareness of the audience.                        </span>

                            <b>📌Body Gesture📌Teamwork📌Fluency</b>
                            <br>
                            After rehearsing with my teammates, we did our best in presenting our ideas. However, despite our efforts to reduce excessive body movements, I found that my body continued to move during the presentation, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. Therefore, I should have made a greater effort to minimize my body gestures.
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, upon reviewing the recording of the presentation, I noticed that I frequently looked at the slides. Instead, I should have had more trust in my teammates and the materials we had prepared. Moving forward, I will focus on improving communication with my teammates and having faith in our teamwork during future presentations.
                            <br>
                            After reviewing the feedback from my instructor, I learned that I made a few slips during the presentation, which could have affected the audience's impression. To improve in future presentations, I will make an effort to familiarize myself with the script by rehearsing more extensively, with the aim of delivering smoother presentations.

                            <b>📌Eye Contact📌Loudness📌Pauses</b>
                            <br />
                            I have reviewed Lin Zhenyi's performance, and I greatly appreciate his excellent eye contact. He rarely looks at the slides and actively engages with various individuals in the audience. His eye contact creates a sense that he is speaking directly to the audience rather than to himself. It would be even better if he could speak louder. Therefore, recording the rehearsals and reviewing the recordings becomes crucial. This enables us to assess our pronunciation and volume, allowing us to make necessary adjustments. Furthermore, I noticed that he incorporates appropriate pauses in his speech, which helps the audience digest the information. This is something I can learn from and implement in my own presentations.
